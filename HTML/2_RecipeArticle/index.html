      <h1>Perfect Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>

    <section class="intro">
      <p>These chocolate chip cookies are everything a cookie should be - soft in the center, crisp on the edges, and loaded with chocolate chips. The brown sugar gives them a wonderful depth of flavor, while a touch of sea salt brings out all the sweet notes. They're perfect with a glass of cold milk!</p>
      <p>I've been perfecting this recipe for years, and I'm excited to share my secrets with you. The key is to refrigerate the dough before baking and to slightly under-bake them so they stay soft and chewy.</p>

          <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened</li>
          <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
          <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
          <li>2 large eggs</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
          <li>2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl or stand mixer, beat the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, mixing on low speed until just combined.</li>
        <li>Fold in the chocolate chips and walnuts (if using) with a rubber spatula.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight. This step is crucial for developing flavor and preventing spreading!</li>
        <li>When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Scoop rounded tablespoons of dough and place them 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake for 9-11 minutes, or until the edges are golden but the centers still look slightly underdone.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
      </ol>
     
      <div class="recipe-note">
        <p><strong>Chef's Note:</strong> For extra-special cookies, try adding 1/4 teaspoon of espresso powder to the dry ingredients. It won't make the cookies taste like coffee, but it will enhance the chocolate flavor!</p>
